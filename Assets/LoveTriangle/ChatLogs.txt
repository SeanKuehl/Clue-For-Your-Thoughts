Jessica: Own what?

Ted: You said you had something you wanted to talk about?
1
Jessica: Yeah, you know that thing we were worried about?
1
Ted: You mean Pregnancy? I always wear protection
1
Jessica: Well I'm pregnant, there'll be no way to hide it from your wife
1
Ted: I don't understand how this could happen
1
Jessica: Maybe it's because you bought those condoms at the dollar store!
1
Ted: So what are you going to do?
1
Jessica: I'm keeping the baby, when the bump shows you'll have to do some explaining
1
Ted: I think you should reconsider, for both of our sakes
