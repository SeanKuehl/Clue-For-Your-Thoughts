Richard and Tessa
1
Richard: I said I’m sorry, can we just get past this!
1
Tessa: Hell no, I still have way too many questions
1
Richard: Do you still think it was meant for another girl?
1
Tessa: Yes!
1
Richard: It’s not! I swear I thought you would like it
1
Tessa: Well you were wrong! Dead wrong!
1
Richard: Look, can I come over so we can work this out?
1
Tessa: Sure, but if we can’t work it out you’re not staying the night

Stacy and Tessa
1
Stacy: Are you still mad about that?
1
Tessa: Yes of course, you tried to turn Richard against me!
1
Stacy: it was just a little gossip
1
Tessa: You told him I screwed my brother!
1
Stacy: Oh come on, it’s not that bad
1
Tessa: You’re lucky he’s so patient or someone like you would scare him
1
Stacy: what ever could you mean?
1
Tessa: A crazy girl that keeps spreading rumors and breaking into my house!
1
Stacy: You’re blowing it out of proportion!
1
Tessa: I locked my bedroom door and you stole the spare and walked in on us!
1
Stacy: so?
1
Tessa: It was my house and neither of us ever let you in!
1
Stacy: Whatever, not like you can stop me

Reginald and Tessa
1
Tessa: Reginald, turn on the lights
1
Reginald: I can’t do that, they are not connected
1
Tessa: You’re not a very good smart home assistant are you?
1
Reginald: Command not recognized
1
Tessa: You can’t even set the smart oven to the right temperature
1
Reginald: Maybe if you didn’t drunkenly slur I could’ve heard you better
1
Tessa: Was that attitude from a fancy toaster?
1
Reginald: No mam, reality
1
Tessa: Well toaster, you’re stuck with me no matter what
