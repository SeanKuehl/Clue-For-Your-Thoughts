A woman was found dead earlier this morning. We've brought in all possible suspects for questioning.
Non of the suspects have been fully cooperative with police, we suspect because they have something to hide.
We do know however that there was only one killer. Find out who's lying and about what. Most importantly,
find out who's lying about not killing someone!
