Delia and Jean
1
Jean: You know I can't let this go on any longer
1
Delia: What are you talking about?
1
Jean: You know damn well what I'm talking about!
1
Delia: Come on, he's my husband. We need the job to support the family
1
Jean: Support his drinking you mean. He's always drunk, never does any works and abuses the rest of us!
1
Delia: oh come on, abuse is a stretch
1
Jean: He hid in the toy isle and right hooked Melina for the hell of it!
1
Delia: Please, you know he's just rough housing
1
Jean: Melina is pregnant and just left an abusive relationship. What part of this is ok?!
1
Delia: What are you saying?
1
Jean: I'm saying you have until the end of the week before I report this the upper management

1
Sally: was he drunk?
1
Jean: he couldn't even stand
1
Sally: then leave his sorry butt!
1
Jean: no! I know it sounds bad but I can fix him!
1
Sally: girl, are you Bob the Builder?
1
Jean: no
1
Sally: then you can't fix him! Let him run around on some other girl!
1
Jean: but he's so cute though...
1
Sally: I swear girl, I might just have to save you from yourself

Thomas: You came home drunk, said nothing and she bought it?
1
Jack: Yep, and I'm gonna do it again next week
1
Thomas: man, this is wrong
1
Jack: you mean what I'm doing?
1
Thomas: no, I mean it's just too easy. This girl has to be hiding something
1
Jack: I don't know man, pretty sure I've seen everything
1
Thomas: I meant figuratively bro. 
1
Jack: So, you don't want me to have fun?
1
Thomas: I'm saying this is the kind of girl to kill you out of nowhere is six months
1
Jack: bro you're just saying this cause you want her
1
Thomas: you know she ain't my type. I'm just saying she shouldn't be yours
1
Jack: when she kicks me out I'll come to your place and we can talk some more
1
Thomas: yeah sure, see you then
