Stan and Jason

Stan: I don't care, you still owe me
1
Jason: aw come on man, it's just one bar tab. Can't you let it go?
1
Stan: 'just one bar tab'?! I was 1000$ I covered for you!
1
Jason: just let it go dude
1
Stan: Not when I've given you four months to pay me back and I hear you're planning a trip to the dominican!
1
Jason: I never asked you to pay my bill
1
Stan: but you did beg me to save your butt from the bar security!
1
Jason: whatever. I'll send you a postcard from the dominican, call it even?
1
Stan: ABSOLUTELY NOT! I'll kill you before I let you get away with this!
