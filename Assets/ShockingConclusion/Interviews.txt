Did you hear about Jason?
1
I didn't hear it, I saw it

You are the one who found Jason's body?
1
Yes, at around 3:00PM I visited him and found him dead in his bath after searching the house.
1
Your DNA was found on the victim's body, can you explain that?
1
That was probably me trying to revive him once I found him
1
You didn't report him dead right away?
1
I didn't think he was dead, maybe just light headed or asleep. Once I couldn't bring him back I called 911

He was sitting up in the bath, slumped over on one side.

No, no signs of electrocution or anything.

There was a toaster in the bath with him

Did you hear about Jason?
1
Yes, I've been trying to block it out
1
Why have you been trying to block it out?
1
Thinking about what happened and what my family must think with me being questioned by the police... it's all just so much
1
Did you have any reason to believe he would take his own life?
1
I heard him and Stan were having a pretty heated fight, I don't know if that would've put him over the edge
1
Where were you around the time of his death?
1
I was out of town running errands. I have the receipts to prove it.

How could I not? It's all over.
1
Did you have any reason to believe he would take his own life?
1
I haven't heard anything specific, but I have heard enough to believe he might have had a reason
1
Where were you around the time of his death?
1
I was having herbal tea at my home 20 minutes away from his. Grew the herbs myself.
