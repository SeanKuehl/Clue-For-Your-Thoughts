Joseph: can we settle this later? Let's change the subject

Ronny: Fine, how about that redhead chick from that Mission Dangerous movie?

Joseph: oh yeah that's a fine lass. Speaking o' which, why ain't there any lady heisters?

Ronny: Y'know I never thought about that. You gonna try to recruit some?
