Joseph: You agreed to it, you'll have to live with it

Ronny: That's not what you used to say

Ronny: clearly it has, this isn't over
1
Joseph: can we settle this later? Let's change the subject

Ronny: Fine, how about that redhead chick from that Mission Dangerous movie?

Ronny: Y'know I never thought about that. You gonna try to recruit some?

Joseph: Maybe, but I'm getting older. Might try to get out of the business soon
