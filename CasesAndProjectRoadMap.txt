cases to add:
-there are interviews from four people, but the actual killer is one of their son's who turned on a smart blender with his hacking skills and killed the guy(you know by something the father says about him)
-a case where something visual in one of the evidence pictures leads you to the killer
-a case where no one is told explicitly what happened to the victim and the killer gives it away by saying something like "It's a shame they were run over"
-a case where you must use small details from the crime scene to figure out who it was(like someone was diabetic and the killer ate a cake for example)
-a case where someone is killed by their smart home's AI assistant(they argue with it etc)
-a case where someone immediatly confesses to the crime but is actually protecting for someone(the person you least expect)
-a case where someone did the crime but it was during a split personality disorder thing so they tell the truth and don't remember
-a case where there is this obvious suspect guy who is framing this calm peaceful girl but there's something that tells you it is actually him
-a case where a kid is interviewed and just goes "your mom" jokes but something in his interview tells you who it is, like once going "my mom"
-case where timing is everything(but the stopped clock as evidence has been tampered with)


TODO:
-scroll text not working!(matter on Dirty Laundry case!)
-add gallery of images from successfully completed cases and showing completed cases on case selection screen(remember text file read/write on executable thing!)
