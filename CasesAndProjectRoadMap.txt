cases to add:
-there are interviews from four people, but the actual killer is one of their son's who turned on a smart blender with his hacking skills and killed the guy(you know by something the father says about him)
-a case where everyone is lying, but only one is lying about not killing the person.
-a case where something visual in one of the evidence pictures leads you to the killer
-a case where several people tried to kill someone but it actually ended up being suicide(they did one of those stupid tik tok trends that got them killed etc.)
-a case where no one is told explicitly what happened to the victim and the killer gives it away by saying something like "It's a shame they were run over"
