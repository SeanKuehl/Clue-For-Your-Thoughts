cases to add:
-there are interviews from four people, but the actual killer is one of their son's who turned on a smart blender with his hacking skills and killed the guy(you know by something the father says about him)
-a case where something visual in one of the evidence pictures leads you to the killer
-a case where someone is killed by their smart home's AI assistant(they argue with it etc)
-a case where someone immediatly confesses to the crime but is actually protecting for someone(the person you least expect)
-a case where someone did the crime but it was during a split personality disorder thing so they tell the truth and don't remember
-a case where there is this obvious suspect guy who is framing this calm peaceful girl but there's something that tells you it is actually him
-a case where a kid is interviewed and just goes "your mom" jokes but something in his interview tells you who it is, like once going "my mom"
-case where timing is everything(but the stopped clock as evidence has been tampered with)



TODO:
-add gallery of images from successfully completed cases and showing completed cases on case selection screen(remember text file read/write on executable thing!)
-add music to menus
-make and add logo to main menu
-make at least 10 cases
-align buttons and other visual items so that nothing looks off
-add icons/images for all buttons(to fix small text in buttonsissue)
-add "no items" thing for each menu to show when there's nothing to show
